## Hand Gesture Recognition Using Flex Sensors
In this project let us see how to design and Implement a circuit to measure the amount of bending/deflection. Using the same implement the system for recognition of Hand gestures.
##Components used :<br>
1)Flex Sensors<br>
2)Resisitors<br>
3)Connecting wires<br>
4)I2C Module<br>
5)Arduino Uno<br>
6)LCD Display.<br>

## Working Principle :
For measuring the degree of bending to detecting hand gestures.Flux sensors are affixed to the fingers and measurements are obtained when the fingers are flexed. The flex sensor functions as a variable resistor, we may obtain readings from it by employing a basic voltage divider.Interfacing the sensor with the voltage divider circuit, which is connected to the Arduino micro controller. Flex the sensor within a range of 0 to 90 degrees and record the corresponding output voltage. Determine the resistance of the flex sensor based on the relationship between voltage and resistance.
